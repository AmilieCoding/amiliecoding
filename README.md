<p align="center">If you need to reach out to me, check out <a href="https://discord.gg/QA4Q2pKTGY">My Discord</a>! Furthermore, if you want to help me on a project I'll be more than happy to accept PR's! (As long as they aren't silly and don't break things of course)</p>

<p align="center">Additionally, Archcord is looking for people to join us! Come check us out at https://archcord.org/, maybe you'll find a new place on Discord (or Revolt) for you to call home.</p>
